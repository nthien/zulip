Hi there!

Welcome to Zulip.

https://{{ external_host }}/hello has a nice overview of what we're up to, but here are a couple tips that'll help you get the most out of it:

1. Zulip works best when it's always open, so grab our apps! (Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS)
   https://{{ external_host }}/apps

2. Want to share files in Zulip? No problem! Start a new message and click the paperclip, or just drag-and-drop the file into the textbox.

3. Trying to get someone's attention? Type in an @-sign followed by their name to "mention" them.

4. Bulleted lists, bold, code blocks, and more are all at your fingertips - just check out "Message formatting" in the gear menu.

5. Are you a keyboard power user? Learn about keyboard shortcuts in the Keyboard Shortcuts tab under the gear icon. (Or press '?')

6. Emoji. Because :ramen:
