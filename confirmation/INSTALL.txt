To install django-confirmation, run the following command inside this
directory:

    python setup.py install

You can also just copy the included ``confirmation`` directory somewhere
on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on your Python path;
this is useful if you're working from a Subversion checkout.

This application requires Python 2.3 or later, and Django 1.0 or later.
You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django from
http://www.djangoproject.com/.
