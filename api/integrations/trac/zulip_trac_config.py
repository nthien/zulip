ZULIP_USER = "trac-bot@example.com"

# Most people find that having every change in Trac result in a
# notification is too noisy -- in particular, when someone goes
# through recategorizing a bunch of tickets, that can often be noisy
# and annoying.  We solve this issue by only sending a notification
# for changes to the fields listed below.
#
# Total list of possible fields is:
# (priority, milestone, cc, owner, keywords, component, severity,
#  type, versions, description, resolution, summary, comment)
#
# The following is the list of fields which can be changed without
# triggering a Zulip notification; change these to match your team's
# workflow.
TRAC_NOTIFY_FIELDS = ["description", "summary", "resolution", "comment", "owner"]

## If properly installed, the Zulip API should be in your import
## path, but if not, set a custom path below
ZULIP_API_PATH = None

# Set this to your Zulip API server URI
