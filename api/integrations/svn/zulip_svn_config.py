# It takes the following arguments:
# * path   = the path to the svn repository on the server
# * commit = the commit id
#
# Returns a dictionary encoding the stream and subject to send the
# notification to (or None to send no notification).
#
# The default code below will send every commit except for the "evil-master-plan"
# and "my-super-secret-repository" repos to
# * stream "commits"
# * topic "branch_name"
