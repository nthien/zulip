# commit_notice_destination() lets you customize where commit notices

# * path   = the path to the Perforce depot on the server
# * changelist = the changelist id
#
# Returns a dictionary encoding the stream and topic to send the
# notification to (or None to send no notification).
#
# The default code below will send every commit except for ones in the
# "master-plan" and "secret" subdirectories of //depot/ to:
# * stream "depot_subdirectory-commits"
# * subject "change_root"
